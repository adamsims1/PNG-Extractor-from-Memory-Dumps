# PNG Extractor from Memory Dumps

This Python script extracts PNG images from Windows process memory dumps (e.g., `.dmp` files) for forensic analysis. It identifies PNG files by their binary signature  and extracts them to a designated output folder. The script was developed as part of a university project focused on memory forensics.

## Features
- Detects and extracts multiple PNG images from a memory dump.
- Creates a unique output folder to avoid overwriting existing files.
- Logs extraction progress and results for easy debugging.
- Lightweight and easy to use with minimal dependencies.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed.
- A Windows memory dump file (`.dmp`) generated by tools like MemProcFS, Process Explorer, or WinPMEM.
